According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[546][547] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[548] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot in order to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[548][549][550] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[551] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it didn't issue a recall when it sent out that update.[552] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to “explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver’s supervision.”[553] 
A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[554] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[555] Several Tesla fans responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[556]

In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[557] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[558] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[559] 
In September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[560] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[561] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[562] 
In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[563][564] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[565] 
In June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changed made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[566] 
Phantom braking[edit]
Tesla drivers have reported a surge in ‘phantom braking’ events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor.[567] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[568] 
Vehicle sales[edit]
In 2021, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling plug-in and battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 14% of the plug-in segment and 21% of the battery electric segment sales.[569] Tesla reported 2021 vehicle deliveries of 936,222 units, up 87% from 2020.[10] At the end of 2021, Tesla's global sales since 2012 totaled 2.3 million units.[570]

Tesla, Inc. (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə[b]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company headquartered in Austin, Texas. Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles (electric cars and trucks), battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and remains the world's most valuable automaker with a market capitalization of more than US$840 billion. The company had the most worldwide sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 21% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market and 14% of the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids) in 2021. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3.99 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2021. 
Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2009. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Model Y crossover in 2020. The Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[9] Tesla's global sales were 936,222 cars in 2021, a 87% increase over the previous year,[10] and cumulative sales totaled 3 million cars as of August 2022.[11] In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history. 
Tesla has been the subject of many lawsuits, increasing government scrutiny, and public controversies arising from statements and acts of CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of creative accounting, whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, and unresolved and dangerous technical problems with their products.

History

See also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla, and Tesla Autopilot § Fatal crashes
In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[535] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[536] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[537] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[538] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause "non-crash" fires.[539][540][541] 
A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[542][543] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[544] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[545] 
According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[546][547] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[548] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot in order to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[548][549][550] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[551] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it didn't issue a recall when it sent out that update.[552] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to “explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver’s supervision.”[553] 
A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[554] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[555] Several Tesla fans responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[556]
