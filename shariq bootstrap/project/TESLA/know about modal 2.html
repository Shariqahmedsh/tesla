Acceleration from 0 to 60 mph will probably be around the five-second mark, with a range of around 200 miles.

Just like the specifications, the design of the Model 2 can only be speculated about, but we may have an idea of how it could look.

The Tesla Model 2 is expected to be a compact but a practical 5-door practical compact car, kind of like a smaller Model Y.

Several renders are circulating the internet, including the interior and exterior.

Most of these renders are not based on any confirmed information. Instead, it is each of the respective artist’s interpretation of what a Model 2 may look like.

We may assume that the Model 2 will not differ significantly from the design language of any type of Tesla – simple and minimal design.

It may be so minimal that Elon Musk hinted that the Model 2 would come without pedals or a steering wheel, aiming to fulfill the vision of fully autonomous driving.

Due to a variety of reasons, such as “having enough on our plate” the Model 2 is currently on hold.

While this may sound discouraging to many people, it is evident that Tesla has much to catch up to with their late releases of the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi.

Nevertheless, we surely haven’t heard the last of the Model 2 as it would be a welcomed model in the Tesla lineup.

We will be sure to be the first to report any news regarding the Tesla Model 2. Stay tuned!
